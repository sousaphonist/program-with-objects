        <p>
          Since many uses of programming involve making multiple elements with similar properties, it helps to use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
        </p>
        <p>
          A <b>class</b> is written, and acts as a guide to describe how the elements within in it are set up and how they may be used. Each individual element then becomes an <b>instance</b> of its parent class, and is commonly referred to as an <b>object</b>.
          Anything in the class which describes basic information which can be attributed to a variable is known as an <b>instance variable</b>. You can also write functions directly into the class, which then become executable <b>instance methods</b>          within the instances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not every class uses both instance variables <i>and</i> instance methods, it all depends on what the class is designed to do. If no instance variables are present, then initializing the class will require no initial data input. However, even
          in this case, there's always an unseen, practically invisible piece of data that's always written into the class itself, known as the <b>self</b> vaiable. When you initialize a class, it begins by partitioning a bit of memory in the computer
          necessary for the class, which uses the method "_init_". All this does is allow the computer to recognize the instance of a class. It will also make sure that it remembers what the class is if you decide to apply a variable name to a given instance
          (which, for clarity and simplicity, is recommended). Although you will never see the self variable when using preexisting classes, you should understand that they wouldn't function properly without them.
        </p>
        <p>
          When using OOP, the class is generally written either at the beginning of the code or, more commonly, on a separate piece of code that's saved within the same folder. In the case of the latter, you have to import the class into your code in the same way you would things from the Python Standard Library (PSL); like <i>twilio</i> or <i>webbrowser</i>. A <b>library</b> is essentially a list of available pre-written classes for you to use. PSL comes pre-loaded with most Python software,
          can can be readily accessed. Other classes however, like <i>twilio</i> or <i>fresh tomatoes</i>, must be sepearately downloaded onto your computer before using.
